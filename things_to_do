- make sure all eta labels are displaying properly (emma)
- use web plot digitizer to extract data from Figure 10 of ECCE note (use red curve, SG) (emma)
- exclude high eta by # of events (bea)
- examine what is happening for 1.5 < eta < 2 (both)
- make title and lable sizes bigger (emma)
- add a legend (emma)

- maybe add plots of dp/p vs eta in bins of pt
- maybe add header file that holds variables
